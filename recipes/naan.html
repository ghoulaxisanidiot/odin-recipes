    <img src = "../images/istockphoto-1143530040-612x612.jpg" alt = "A Delicious Piece of Naan with Butter and some Greens">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This homemade naan recipe makes soft, chewy naan with a buttery taste. 
        It is the best I have tasted outside of an Indian restaurant. 
        Simply delicious eaten warm brushed with melted butter 
        or served with your favorite curry.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Water - 1 cup</li>
        <li>Active Dry Yeast - 1 packet</li>
        <li>White Sugar - 1/4 cups</li>
        <li>Milk - 3 tablespoons</li>
        <li>Egg - 1</li>
        <li>Salt - 2 tablespoons</li>
        <li>Bread Flour - 4 1/2 cups</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large bowl. Let stand about 10 minutes, until frothy.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, generously oil a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Stir sugar, milk, egg, and salt into the yeast mixture. Mix in enough flour to make a soft dough.</li>
        <li>Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth, 6 to 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place dough in the prepared oil, cover with a damp cloth, and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Punch down dough on a lightly floured surface, and knead in garlic. 
            Pinch off small handfuls of dough about the size of a golf ball; you should have about 14.</li>
        <li>Roll each piece into a ball and place on a tray. Cover with a towel, and allow to rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, preheat a large grill pan over high heat.</li>
        <li>Roll each piece of dough into a thin circle.</li>
        <li>Brush some melted butter on the preheated grill pan. 
            Place a few pieces of dough in the pan (as many as you can fit) and cook until puffy and lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Brush butter onto the uncooked sides, flip, and cook until browned, 2 to 4 more minutes. 
            Remove from the grill and repeat to cook the remaining naan.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your freshly grilled butter naan!</li>
