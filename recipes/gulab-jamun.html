    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a traditional Indian dessert. Spongy milky balls soaked in rose scented syrup. 
        Delicious with fresh cream, Kulfi, ice cream etc. 
        To make it even more fancy, sprinkle gold-leaf on top of each serving.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Water - 2 Cups</li>
        <li>White Sugar - 2 Cups</li>
        <li>Ground Cardamom - 1/2 teaspoon</li>
        <li>Dry Milk Powder - 1/2 Cup</li>
        <li>All-Purpose Flour - 2 tablespoons</li>
        <li>Baking Soda - 1/4 teaspoon</li>
        <li>Unsalted Butter - 1 tablespoon</li>
        <li>Plain Yogurt - 2 tablespoons</li>
        <li>Vegetable Oil - 2 Cups</li>
        <li>Rose Water - 2 drops (Optional)</li>
        <li>Saffron - 1 pinch (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine water, sugar, cardamom, rose water, and saffron in a saucepan; bring to a boil. 
            Reduce heat and simmer until consistency is syrupy, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix milk powder, flour, and baking soda in a bowl until well-combined. 
            Slowly mix in butter and yogurt until dough comes together. Let gulab dough rest for 5 minutes. 
            Shape into smooth balls the size of pennies.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Test the temperature of the oil by dropping in a small piece of dough. 
            When it sits at the bottom of the pan for 1 minute before coming to the surface, the oil is ready.</li>
        <li>Fry 4 gulab balls at a time, stirring carefully, until dark golden brown on all sides, about 2 minutes. 
            Drain on a paper-towel lined plate. Repeat with remaining gulab.</li>
        <li>Bring syrup back up to a boil and drop in fried gulab. 
            Remove from heat and let them soak in the syrup, covered, 45 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Cook's Notes:</h4>
    <p>Try adding ice cream to these hot waffle balls, you'll be delighted!
    The longer you leave the waffle balls in the syrup the better it is going to be; some people leave the waffle balls overnight.</p>
